## Project Overview

adventor is an Advent of Code CLI Tool is a command-line interface application designed to streamline the setup process for Advent of Code challenges. This tool allows users to quickly create a structured folder for each challenge day, download the corresponding input file, and generate a basic C code template for parsing the input.

## Features

- **Folder Structure Creation**: Automatically creates a directory structure for each challenge, such as `/2024/day1`.
- **Input File Download**: Fetches the input file for the specified day and year from the Advent of Code website and saves it in the appropriate folder.
- **Code Template Generation**: Generates a basic C code template that includes functionality to read and parse the input file, which is in most cases a repetitive process and similar across challenges

## Potential Features 
- Multi language boilerplate setup
- Auto submit
- Turning the problem description into a more readable format and putting it in the problem directory to prevent having to keep checking.
